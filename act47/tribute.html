      <br>
      <br>Mom, you're a wonderful mother,
<br>So gentle, yet so strong.
<br>The many ways you show you care
<br>Always make me feel I belong.
 <br> 
 <br>You're patient when I'm foolish;
<br>You give guidance when I ask;
<br>It seems you can do most anything;
<br>You're the master of every task.
 <br>
 <br>You're a dependable source of comfort;
<br>You're my cushion when I fall.
<br>You help in times of trouble;
<br>You support me whenever I call.
 <br>
  <br>I love you more than you know;
<br>You have my total respect.
<br>If I had my choice of mothers,
<br>You'd be the one I'd select! 
      <br>

      The person that I admire the most is my <br>family, especially my mother who work abroad <br>just to sustain my needs in life, she worked <br>there for almost 9 years and even she's in <br>another country she did not forget to teach me <br>about being a good person and a good son,in <br>the near future I want to give back to them <br>the hardship that they do in order to sustain <br>my needs as a person and a student and give <br>them the happiest moment in their lives.

      My wish for my family
